# ⚠️ Known Issues

We're continuously improving Kore, but there are a few known issues to be aware of:

## Current Limitations

- **Team Loading Delay**: After clicking a team, it can take a bit until it loads.
- **Unresponsive Team After Stop**: After pressing stop, when asking for a new requirement if the team is unresponsive and appears to have stopped after you sent that requirement, just send another equal request and it should awake the team and get them to work.
- **Revert Button Behavior**: After pressing revert you might have to press stop to forcefully force the frontend to update and let you run! If after sending the first request nothing happens, send a second identical request as described before.

## Workarounds

For most issues related to unresponsiveness:

1. Try sending the same request again
2. Use the **Stop Execution** button to reset the system state
3. Refresh the page as a last resort

We appreciate your patience as we work to resolve these issues!
