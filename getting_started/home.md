## **Define Your Objective**
### New Project, Existing Assets, or Knowledge Discovery?
Compass is designed for versatility, adapting seamlessly to your specific needs. Choose the path that aligns with your current goals:

- **Starting a New Endeavor**: If you're building something from the ground up, select the "New Project" option. You'll gain access to our extensive collection of **tech stack templates**, providing a robust, standardized foundation for your initiatives. These templates are intelligently guided by **CompassRules** to ensure optimal AI generation tailored to your chosen environment. Simply describe your vision with a prompt, and let our agents begin to scaffold your application or solution.
- **Enhancing Existing Assets**: For current projects, applications, or documents, opt to "Connect Your Repository" or upload your files. Compass offers seamless **Git integration** for codebases, and supports direct uploads or links from platforms like Microsoft OneDrive and SharePoint for documents. Our AI agents will then analyze your connected assets, understanding their context and preparing them for enhancement or analysis.
- **Unlocking Organizational Knowledge**: If your goal is to extract insights from vast amounts of data, choose to leverage our knowledge base capabilities. Connect diverse sources, from internal documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDFs) to external web pages via URLs, and prepare to discover hidden information.

## **Engage Your AI Agents**
Once your objective is set, you can begin interacting with Compass's specialized AI agents:

- **For Development & Implementation**: Direct your requests to the AI Software Team for tasks ranging from new feature development and code modifications to architectural planning. You can engage the entire team for comprehensive projects or target specific agents, like @Martha (Product Manager), @Bruce (Architect), or @Nova (Software Engineer), for focused interventions.

- **For Documentation & Insights**: Utilize the Knowledge Base agent to learn about your data sources. Beyond generation, you can ask natural language questions to swiftly extract insights and synthesize information from all your connected data sources.

## **Review, Refine, and Integrate**
Compass emphasizes user control and iterative improvement:

- **Review Agent Outputs**: Always review the generated code, documentation, or insights provided by the agents. This is your critical opportunity to ensure the output precisely meets your quality standards and specific requirements.
- **Provide Iterative Feedback**: Compass's interactive design allows you to directly engage with the agents, answering their clarifying questions or guiding their subsequent steps. This continuous feedback loop deepens their understanding of your preferences and project nuances, leading to increasingly accurate and tailored results.
- **Seamless Integration**: Once you are fully satisfied with the output, you can seamlessly integrate the changes â€“ whether merging generated code into your main branch, downloading finalized documentation, or utilizing extracted knowledge for strategic decisions.

We're confident that Compass will quickly become an indispensable asset for enhancing your enterprise productivity, enabling your teams to deliver high-quality outcomes faster and more efficiently.
