## Getting Started

1. **Create a Team**: Start by creating a new team - either from scratch or by connecting to an existing Git repository.

1. **Make Your Request**: Tell the agents what you want to build or modify
2. **Review & Iterate**: Check the generated code, provide feedback, and continue development

## Quick Tips

- Direct your requests by tagging specific agents (e.g., @Tilda, @Bruce)
- Be specific about what you want to achieve
- Add knowledge to help the agents understand your requirements better
- Request one feature at a time for faster development cycles
