# ðŸš€ Getting Up and Running

## **Choose Your AI Team**
On the Kore homepage, identify and select the AI team that aligns with your current objective. Kore offers various expert teams, from 'AI Knowledge Base' for information retrieval to 'AI Software Company' for development tasks, ensuring you have the right support for your needs.

## **Set Up Your Agents**
After selecting your AI Team, you'll be presented with the agents that comprise that team. Here, you can:
- Choose an LLM: Configure the underlying Large Language Model that will drive your agents' capabilities â€” with the option to integrate Private LLMs for complete data privacy and safety.
- Initiate a Project: Start a new project or connect to an existing one via Git, providing the necessary repository URL and token.
- Tailor Advanced Settings: Depending on the AI Team you selected (e.g., 'AI Software Company'), you may have access to advanced configuration options. This includes specifying your preferred technology stack to ensure the agents operate within your desired development environment and connect to a git repository.

## **Communicate Your Vision**
This is where you engage your AI team. Describe what you want to achieve â€“ whether it's querying the 'AI Knowledge Base' for information, building a software component with the 'AI Software Company', or analyzing data with another team.

Provide a clear and comprehensive prompt, as the more context and detail you offer, the more precisely the agents can tailor their response or deliver the desired output.

## **Shaping Your Results**
Once your Kore agents have processed your request, the journey doesn't end â€“ it evolves. Kore is designed for dynamic collaboration, enabling you to review the initial output and seamlessly refine it through an iterative feedback loop. This continuous engagement ensures the final deliverables perfectly align with your vision.

The nature of this iteration adapts to the AI Team you're working with:

- For Conversational AI Teams (e.g., AI Knowledge Base): When interacting with teams focused on direct answers or information retrieval, the review and iteration process is as intuitive as a chat. You'll receive a direct response, and you can immediately provide follow-up questions, clarify details, request more depth, or refine your original query. This allows for rapid fine-tuning of information and immediate satisfaction of your knowledge needs.

- For Project-Oriented AI Teams (e.g., AI Software Company): With teams that deliver tangible project components like code, Kore promotes a robust, continuous development workflow. The agents will deliver features and modifications using standard Git practices, including dedicated branches and commits. You can review the proposed changes, test the new functionality, and provide detailed feedback directly within the platform. Kore then intelligently incorporates this feedback into subsequent iterations, committing new changes to the repository. This sophisticated integration allows for the continuous leverage of agent-generated work, fostering a truly agile development cycle where human expertise and AI capabilities build upon each other, commit by commit.

In essence, Kore transforms **static** outputs into **living** projects, allowing you to continuously shape, enhance, and ultimately perfect the work delivered by your AI agents.


## Quick Tips

- Be specific about what you want to achieve
- Add long-term and semantic knowledge to help the agents understand your requirements better
