They are more than just a writing tool; they are a sophisticated system for knowledge synthesis and document generation. By leveraging a unique "Writing Blueprint," the Drafsmiths ensure that every document is not only well-written but also perfectly aligned with its intended purpose, audience, and tone.

**Meet Your AI Writing Guild:**

The Drafsmiths team is a synergistic collective of specialized agents, each mastering a critical phase of the document creation lifecycle.

| Agent | Role | Core Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Albert** | 📚 **Knowledge Seeker** | The diligent researcher, Albert delves into the provided knowledge sources—documents, repositories, and APIs—to gather and synthesize the information needed to build a comprehensive and accurate document. |
| **Neil** | ✍️ **Lead Scribe** | The master of language and structure, Neil interprets the Writing Blueprint to orchestrate the narrative, ensuring the document's tone, style, and content are flawless. |

## The Writing Blueprint: Your Document's DNA

At the heart of the Drafsmiths' process is the **Writing Blueprint**. This is where you lay the foundation for your document, defining every critical aspect to guide the AI team. The blueprint is your director's brief, ensuring the final output is precisely what you envisioned.

The Writing Blueprint allows you to specify:

*   **What needs to be written?**: A clear and detailed description of the document's subject matter.
*   **Who will read it?**: Define your target audience to tailor the language and complexity.
*   **What's the main goal?**: Articulate the primary objective of the document—to inform, persuade, instruct, or entertain.
*   **What tone should it have?**: Choose from a spectrum of tones, from formal and academic to casual and conversational.
*   **Length**: Specify the desired length of the document.
*   **Additional Context**: Provide any other relevant information, such as key points to include, specific data to reference, or a desired structure.

The blueprint governs every detail, from the high-level structure to the granular details of each section, ensuring a consistent and high-quality result.

## The Blueprint Marketplace: A Hub of Expertise

The Compass Agentic Platform introduces a revolutionary **Blueprint Marketplace**, a collaborative space where users within your organization can share and reuse Writing Blueprints. This powerful feature allows you to tap into the collective wisdom of your team.

*   **Share and Discover:** Experts in your organization can create and upload "master blueprints" for documents that are frequently created, such as project proposals, compliance reports, technical specifications, or marketing materials.
*   **Ensure Consistency:** By using pre-approved blueprints, you can ensure that all documents of a certain type adhere to the same high standards of quality and structure.
*   **Accelerate Creation:** Instead of starting from scratch, you can select a proven blueprint from the marketplace, saving time and effort while leveraging the expertise of your colleagues.

## Enriching the Context: Fueling the AI's Knowledge

Once your Writing Blueprint is in place, you can interact with the Drafsmiths team just as you would with any other team in the Compass Agentic Platform. To create truly exceptional documents, you can enrich the agents' context by providing them with a wealth of information through the **Knowledge** section:

*   **Upload Documents:** Provide existing documents, research papers, or any other relevant files.
*   **Connect to Git Repositories:** Allow the agents to access and understand codebases for technical documentation.
*   **Set up APIs:** Connect to live data sources to include real-time information in your documents.
*   **Activate Model Context Protocols (MCP) Servers:** Enhance the agents' capabilities with specialized tools.

## Visual Storytelling: Images, Diagrams, and Charts

A picture is worth a thousand words, and the Drafsmiths team takes this to heart. The agents are fully capable of generating a wide range of visual aids to complement your text:

*   **Illustrative Images:** Create custom images to make your document more engaging.
*   **Informative Diagrams:** Generate clear and concise diagrams to explain complex concepts.
*   **Data-Driven Charts:** Produce charts and graphs to visualize data and support your arguments.

These visuals are seamlessly integrated into the document, providing clarity, illustrating examples, or simply adding a touch of media-rich content to a specific section.
