## The Writing Blueprint: Your Document's DNA

At the heart of the Drafsmiths' process is the **Writing Blueprint**. This is where you lay the foundation for your document, defining every critical aspect to guide the AI team. The blueprint is your director's brief, ensuring the final output is precisely what you envisioned.

The Writing Blueprint allows you to specify:

*   **What needs to be written?**: A clear and detailed description of the document's subject matter.
*   **Who will read it?**: Define your target audience to tailor the language and complexity.
*   **What's the main goal?**: Articulate the primary objective of the document—to inform, persuade, instruct, or entertain.
*   **What tone should it have?**: Choose from a spectrum of tones, from formal and academic to casual and conversational.
*   **Length**: Specify the desired length of the document.
*   **Additional Context**: Provide any other relevant information, such as key points to include, specific data to reference, or a desired structure.

The blueprint governs every detail, from the high-level structure to the granular details of each section, ensuring a consistent and high-quality result.
