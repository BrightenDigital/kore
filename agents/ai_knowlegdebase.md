# Knowledge Base agent

The **Knowledge Base** agent is a powerful AI-driven component designed to ingest, understand, and retrieve knowledge from a multitude of structured and unstructured data sources. Its primary purpose is to enable intelligent, contextual responses to user queries using a sophisticated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline.

## Introduction

The **Knowledge Base** agent is a **cognitive agent** capable of dynamically sourcing, reasoning, and responding to questions by intelligently navigating through:

- Uploaded documents
- Organization-managed knowledge bases
- Live databases (via schema-aware queries)

It bridges the gap between data availability and actionable knowledge by applying a layered understanding and retrieval strategy.

## Multi-Source Querying

When a user interacts with the agent, the following process unfolds:

1. **Input Analysis**: The agent interprets the question using a language model, identifying key terms and intent.
2. **Source Matching**: It queries multiple knowledge sources:
   - Semantic documents uploaded to Kore
   - Internal knowledge systems (wikis, manuals, repositories)
   - Connected relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
3. **Context Retrieval**: Uses vector similarity search, keyword ranking, and schema inference to retrieve relevant content.

### Semantic Classification

All uploaded documents go through semantic parsing and are indexed accordingly:

| Document Type              | Description                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-source knowledge     | Classification Strategy                           |
| PDFs                       | Vector embeddings + BM25                          |
| Spreadsheets               | Table parsing + embeddings                        |
| Wikis / Markdown           | Chunked + hierarchical RAG                        |


## Query Lifecycle
Here's how the agent processes a question from start to finish:

User submits a question
1. Initial context search across:
2. Kore RAG-indexed documents
   - Live databases (with schema inference)
   - Internal repositories
3. Reference extraction: Lists supporting documents, tables, or database records.
4. Answer synthesis: The agent generates a response only if the retrieved context is sufficient.
5. Iterative search: If context is incomplete, the agent automatically re-queries or refines its strategy.

B --> C[Initial Retrieval]
C --> D{Context Found?}
D -- Yes --> E[List References]
E --> F[Generate Answer]
D -- No --> G[Re-query / Refine]
G --> C
```

## Database Intelligence
One standout feature of the agent is its ability to connect to databases and reason about them dynamically:
- Inspects schema on-the-fly
- Generates safe, optimized SQL queries
- Joins contextual data with document-based knowledge
- Supports federated querying across multiple sources

ðŸ’¡ This allows Kore to provide precise answers even when the knowledge resides in structured tabular formats.

## Adaptive Reasoning
The Kore agent does not stop at the first layer of information. It adapts its approach:
- If initial results are ambiguous or incomplete, it expands its query.
- Can switch strategies between keyword search and semantic reasoning.
- Designed to respond only when confident, reducing hallucinations.

## Use Cases
- Internal Q&A assistants for enterprises
- Technical documentation bots
- Support automation for complex product suites
- Domain-specific compliance bots (e.g., pharma, legal, finance)
