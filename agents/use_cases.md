# Real-World Examples: Putting AI to Work

Welcome to our collection of real-world success stories. Discover how Compass empowers teams to solve concrete business problems, drive efficiency, and create value.

## Instantly Find Answers in Your Business Data

**The Challenge:** Your organization's most valuable information—answers to customer questions, competitive insights, and internal process details—is often buried in mountains of documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Finding the right answer quickly is a major daily roadblock.

**The Compass Solution:** The **Knowledge Base agent** acts like a super-powered search engine that understands your business. Connect it to your shared drives (like Microsoft OneDrive or SharePoint), upload files, or even point it to websites. Then, simply ask questions in plain English.

For a **business user**, this means no more hunting for files. You can ask, "What were our Q1 sales figures for the Alpha project?" or "Find the latest approved marketing copy for our new service," and get a direct answer with sources.

> **For the CXO:** This isn't just a search tool; it's a way to unlock your organization's collective intelligence. When everyone can find information instantly, decision-making accelerates, and you foster a data-driven culture from the ground up.

## Deploy an On-Demand Expert for Your Team

**The Challenge:** Every department has experts who spend too much time answering the same repetitive questions about processes, policies, or project status. This slows down both the expert and the employees who need help.

**The Compass Solution:** Deploy a smart and secure **Enterprise Knowledge Chatbot** on your company intranet or team portal. This AI-powered expert connects to your department's documents and knowledge bases to provide instant, accurate answers 24/7.

For a **business user**, it's like having an on-demand expert. New hires can get up to speed faster, and existing employees can self-serve answers to their questions without interrupting a colleague.

> **For the CXO:** This directly impacts productivity and operational efficiency. It reduces internal friction, ensures everyone works with consistent information, and frees up your most valuable employees to focus on high-impact work instead of repetitive support tasks.

## Create High-Impact Documents, Effortlessly

**The Challenge:** Creating strategic documents like business proposals, market analyses, or compliance reports is slow and resource-intensive. Ensuring quality and consistency across the organization is a constant struggle.

**The Compass Solution:** The **Drafsmiths Team** turns document creation into a streamlined, AI-powered workflow. It starts with a "Writing Blueprint" where you define the document's goal, audience, and tone. The AI agents then research the topic using your connected data, write the content, and even create supporting visuals like charts and diagrams.

For a **business user**, this means you can generate a polished first draft of a complex document in a fraction of the time, allowing you to focus on refining the strategy and message.

> **For the CXO:** This capability allows you to standardize excellence. You can establish "master blueprints" for critical documents (like sales proposals or project reports), ensuring quality and brand consistency across the entire business. It accelerates the pace of business by turning ideas into shareable, high-quality content faster than ever before.

## Turn Raw Data into Insightful Dashboards in Minutes

**The Challenge:** You have valuable data locked in an Excel file or spreadsheet, but turning it into a useful dashboard to spot trends requires technical help from a data analyst, which can take days or weeks.

**The Compass Solution:** With the **Business BI Team**, any user can become a data analyst. Simply give the agents your Excel file, and they will automatically analyze it, identify key insights, and generate a fully interactive, real-time dashboard.

For a **business user**, this is empowering. You can now visualize your team's performance, track project metrics, or analyze sales figures on your own, without waiting for the BI team.

> **For the CXO:** This democratizes data and accelerates the speed of business. It empowers leaders at all levels to visualize key metrics and uncover trends at a glance, fostering faster, data-driven decisions without the delays and costs of manual reporting cycles.

## Launch a Project or Department Portal—No Coding Required

**The Challenge:** Your department has a wealth of knowledge and project documents, but they are scattered. You want to create a central hub to showcase your work and share information, but you don't have the time or budget for a web development project.

**The Compass Solution:** Simply point the Compass agents to your collection of documents. They will intelligently organize the content, create a professional and intuitive web interface, and deploy it as a fully functional portal.

For a **business user**, this is the easiest way to build a team site. You can create a polished, central resource for your project or department in minutes, improving team collaboration and visibility.

> **For the CXO:** This breaks down information silos. It provides you with a transparent, real-time view of project status and team accomplishments across the organization. It fosters a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, all without any additional IT overhead.

## Create Living Documentation for Your Software

**The Challenge:** Technical documentation for software is almost always outdated, making it hard for new developers to get up to speed and for existing teams to maintain complex systems.

**The Compass Solution:** The **AI Software Team** treats documentation as a live, integrated part of your software. Instead of relying on manual updates, you can point the agents to your code repositories. They perform a deep analysis to automatically generate a complete, interactive documentation portal that is always in sync with your actual system.

> **Example:** *"Scan our 'order-processing' and 'inventory-service' code. Generate a documentation portal with API details, database diagrams, and a chart showing how a new order updates the inventory."*

> **For the CXO:** This directly reduces project risk and improves engineering efficiency. Accurate documentation accelerates developer onboarding, reduces maintenance costs, and is critical for system governance and scalability. It ensures that your valuable technical knowledge is never lost, even when team members change.

## Build Custom Business Apps at Speed

**The Challenge:** Your business has a unique operational bottleneck—in the warehouse, in finance, in HR—that off-the-shelf software can't solve. A custom solution would be perfect, but traditional development projects are too slow and expensive.

**The Compass Solution:** The **AI Software Team** can build and deploy high-quality, enterprise-grade applications tailored to your exact process. Simply describe your business need in detail, and the agents will design the architecture and generate the production-ready code for platforms like SAPUI5 and others.

> **Example:** *"Build an SAPUI5 app for our warehouse. It needs to let operators scan deliveries, confirm quantities, and upload photos of damaged goods. This should automatically trigger a quality inspection in our SAP QM system."*

> **For the CXO:** This represents a paradigm shift in business agility. You can now solve specific operational problems with custom-fit applications in a fraction of the time and cost. This allows you to innovate and optimize your core business processes at a pace that was previously unimaginable.

## Modernize Critical Applications, Minus the Risk

**The Challenge:** Your business relies on older, legacy applications. They are critical, but their outdated technology prevents you from innovating, poses a security risk, and is expensive to maintain. Modernizing them is a massive, high-risk project.

**The Compass Solution:** The **AI Software Team** becomes your expert partner in modernization. The agents analyze your legacy codebase (e.g., COBOL, old Java) to automatically document its functionality, extract the invaluable business logic, and recommend a plan to rebuild it as a modern, scalable, and secure application.

> **Example:** *"Analyze our old COBOL payment system. Tell us the best way to refactor it into a modern microservice and generate the new code."*

> **For the CXO:** This fundamentally de-risks and accelerates digital transformation. You can preserve the critical business rules locked in your legacy systems while eliminating technical debt. This allows you to transition to efficient, secure, and cloud-ready architectures with confidence, future-proofing your business and unlocking new opportunities for growth.

## Go from System Alert to Proactive Fix, Instantly

**The Challenge:** When a critical system has a problem, the clock is ticking. Your best engineers drop everything to firefight, trying to find the root cause while your business and customers are impacted.

**The Compass Solution:** The **AI Software Team** can act as a 24/7 first responder. By connecting to your live monitoring tools (like PagerDuty or New Relic), your codebase, and even your customer support tickets (like Zendesk), the agents can perform an instant, holistic analysis the moment an alert fires. They can pinpoint the root cause, assess the business impact, and draft a precise code fix for your team to review.

> **Example:** *"We just got a PagerDuty alert for high latency on our payment gateway. Check the logs, find the code commit that caused it, see if customers are complaining in Zendesk, and draft a hotfix."*

> **For the CXO:** This transforms your operations from reactive to proactive. It dramatically reduces system downtime and the business impact of outages, protecting both revenue and brand reputation. It frees your senior engineers from constant firefighting, allowing them to focus on innovation and building the future of your business. This represents a major leap in operational resilience and efficiency.
