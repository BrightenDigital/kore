## 3. System Interactions and Data Flows

### 3.1 Primary User Flows

### Document Search Flow

1. User submits search query via CompassAI frontend
2. CompassAPI validates request and routes to CompassFastRag
3. CompassFastRag performs BM25 and vector search
4. ModelContextProtocol servers prepare context
5. Results returned to frontend with relevant documents

### Microsoft 365 Integration Flow

1. User requests documents from M365 services
2. CompassGraphAPI authenticates via Security component
3. CompassGraphAPI retrieves documents from appropriate service
4. Documents are processed and returned to frontend

### AI Processing Flow

1. User submits content for AI processing
2. CompassAPI routes request to AI Core
3. AI Core determines appropriate model (external or CompassSLM)
4. Model processes content with context from ModelContextProtocol
5. Results returned to user with appropriate formatting

### Security Validation Flow

1. Components require authentication for operations
2. Security component validates credentials
3. Valid requests proceed, invalid ones are rejected and logged
4. All validation activities logged to Observability

### 3.2 Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Monitoring and Observability

- All components emit telemetry to Observability backend
- Metrics, logs, and traces are collected and analyzed
- Dashboards provide real-time visibility into system health
- AI interactions are logged for compliance and improvement

### Security and Authentication
