# üõ†Ô∏è Implement a new feature

Adding features to your existing code is where Kore truly shines:

1. **Connect Your Repository**: Use Git integration to connect your existing codebase
2. **Let Agents Analyze**: The team will automatically analyze your codebase
3. **Request Your Feature**: Be specific about what you want to implement
4. **Review Implementation**: Check the generated code and provide feedback
5. **Merge When Ready**: When satisfied, merge the changes into your main branch

For best results:

- Be specific about file locations and components that need modification
- Provide context about your project's architecture and dependencies
- Break complex features into smaller requests
