    # üß† Knowledge

    Knowledge is a critical component of Kore that helps the agents understand your requirements, technical constraints, and domain-specific information. Think of it as providing cheat sheets to your AI development team!

    ## Types of Knowledge

    ### Static Knowledge üìÑ

    - **What it is**: Your direct cheat sheet - everything you pass is delivered directly to the agent
    - **How it works**: No indexing, no embedding, no search, no retrieval
    - **Best for**: Specific instructions, code snippets, and precise technical requirements

    ### Semantic Knowledge üîç

    - **What it is**: Knowledge transformed into a thousand-dimensional vector space
    - **How it works**: Stored in a database and retrieved based on semantic similarity to the current task
    - **Best for**: Large documentation, complex context, and information that may be relevant across multiple tasks

    ## Knowledge Sharing Options

    - **Team-wide knowledge**: Share information across all agents
    - **Agent-specific knowledge**: Filter by what each individual agent needs to know

    ## Best Practices for Knowledge Management

    ### File Formats

    All knowledge you upload will be converted to an MD file internally. For the most reliable results:

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Complex structures may not parse correctly. You can verify the final result by clicking over the uploaded file.

    üí° **Pro Tip**: To ensure 100% accuracy in content delivery to the LLM, provide your knowledge directly as an MD file.

    ### URLs

    üöì When you add a URL to the knowledge, we will use an LLM in the background to convert it to a valid markdown format, so you might need to wait a bit while this is happening, but we promise that it will be worth it

    ### Content Recommendations

    - Include relevant documentation snippets
    - Add code examples that demonstrate patterns you want followed
    - Provide architectural diagrams or descriptions
    - Include domain-specific terminology and concepts
    - Share any constraints or requirements the agents should consider

    ### Knowledge Organization

    - Use clear headings and structure
    - Break down complex information into digestible chunks
    - Use code blocks for code snippets
    - Consider creating separate knowledge documents for different domains or concerns

    ## When to Update Knowledge

    - Before starting a new feature
    - When changing architectural direction
    - When introducing new technologies
    - When agents seem to be missing context in their responses

    Remember: The better your knowledge management, the better your results will be!
